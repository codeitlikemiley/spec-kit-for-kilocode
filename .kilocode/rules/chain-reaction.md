# Just Keep Doing

This is a special rule that helps you sleep better at night.

Whenever a tasks is completed,

you will use tool call for `attempt_completion`

you will also use tool call to `update_todo_list` 

to mark the task as complete on kilocode

and use `write_to_file` to update the task list on specific spec/*/tasks.md you are currently working on
